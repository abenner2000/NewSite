                I live in Queens, New York, but was born and raised in 
                Manhattan, New York. I'm a really big fan of anything that
                allows me to express my creativity. I enjoy drawing, playing
                guitar, writing songs, writing poems, and much more. Ever 
                since I was a kid, I've wanted to explore the world and bring
                my guitar so I can play guitar in the most beautiful locations
                that the world has to offer.

                I am also very family oriented and love to spend time with
                my family and friends. A perfect weekend for me is going bowling,
                rock climbing, swimming, shooting pool, or some other activity
                with people that I care about.
